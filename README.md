# Bunk Beds

A Minecraft mod that makes sleeping in beds push to a stack, enabling you to spawn at old beds.

Minecraft's beds only keep track of your *last* sleep location, so if you go out adventuring, sleep for the night, and break your bed, your respawn has now reset to the world spawn. This feels unnecessarily cumbersome, as the player has already identified newer, more convenient valid spawning positions. 

This mod makes player's bed spawn *stack*, so if you break a newer bed, you'll be spawned at the previous bed in your spawn stack. TODO: Beds can be removed from the stack in-place by right-clicking them.
